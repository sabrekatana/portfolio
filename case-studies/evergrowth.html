          Transitioning careers can be challenging, especially if you don't know
          how to translate your past experience into skills that can land you
          the role you want. With so many services out there, it can be even
          harder to decide which ones will serve you best. Finding information
          to start you on your new path should be easy to navigate, and should
          leave you feeling empowered.

            Evergrowth Coach LLC is a career development service that aims to
            help those without traditional work experience transition into a new
            career. As the owner and operator, Jennifer does not want her
            company to come across as a "resume mill", and therefore wanted to
            make sure that users knew they would be getting a personalized
            experience and that they would leave feeling inspired and confident.

            Redesigning the website for Evergrowth Coach was all about
            identifying the users' needs and highlighting the company's

            design makes the information clear and accessible, creating a great
            user experience as they navigate finding a service that works best
            for them.

            After research and an interview with the owner of Evergrowth Coach

            benefit from the provided services.

            As we began this project, it was first important to gain an
            understanding of the function of the client’s current site, what she
            felt was or wasn’t working, and what her clients were experiencing
            as pain points. We sought to understand which design elements were
            most important to Jennifer, what she needed to get across to clients
            that she wasn’t already, and what kind of goals she had for her
            company. We found these answers through an assessment of her
            original site as well as an interview with Jennifer. Our interview
            questions included:

            <li>
              What are 2-3 things you want visitors to your website to know from

            Through examining the website based on the perspective of a client,
            we were able to assess several specific pain points that users would

          <ul>

            We examined three similar career coaching websites to analyze how

            the strengths and overall experience of navigating The Muse, Top
            Stack Resume, and Resumes Planet. <br />
            By assessing these websites from the perspective of a user, we
            created a list of important improvements we should implement in

          women and veteran job-seekers looking to progress in their careers.
          Based on the information that Jennifer provided to us on her target
          clients, we developed two personas to better understand the problems
          and goals that represent the main users of the website.

            Upon evaluating the state of navigation of the client's original

            to find the most relevant information. The sorting of information
            was also hard to understand and navigate. As we redesigned the site
            map, it was important for us to consolidate information, put the
            most important information to the client and her users on the
            homepage, and make clear the content of the site with the different
            categories.

            flow allowed us to understand the journey of the user and following
            a few revisions, we drafted the main routes that would guide our
            redesign.

            flows. We sketched out our ideas and were able to have a better idea
            of how the website would look and were able to move forward to the
            wireframes and high fidelity screens. These sketches were a way to
            bring our user flows to life and were the start of beginning an
            intuitive user experience.

            experience by making sure the next step in the user flow was clear.
            <br />
            The user could navigate back to the previous screen or home section
            by adding a back button when the user was finished paying for their
            package or when they filled out a form. Additionally, we accounted
            for easier social media access by condensing down the podcast
            section into one area and organizing the novels and creating an
            additional page for all articles.

            To set a guideline for our design and establish consistency we
            created a style guide that incorporated our choice of font, colors,
            grid, imagery and logo. Our client’s color inspiration stemmed from
            the idea of growth; therefore, our team enhanced this idea by
            combining colors that evoked feelings of growth while also
            accounting for the sense of confidence the user experiences while
            navigating the content of the site.

          <div class="project-body">
            Our team collaborated on 20 high fidelity wireframes for four main
            sectors: landing page, about section, services section and media
            section. We valued an easy to navigate experience that established a
            sense of confidence for the user both in using the site and in the
            content of the site. This process was highly iterative, and after
            many iterations we were able to reach our final UI. A final
            walkthrough occurred to fine tune the details of each page.

            When a user first enters the company’s website, they will land on
            the homepage. Prior to our team’s redesign, information overload on
            the homepage made it difficult to funnel users directly to service
            packages. Our team removed unnecessary content from the homepage and
            organized it to clearly emphasize the brand attributes of Evergrowth
            Coach and its services.

            During our final presentation, we demonstrated the navigation
            process by reviewing each step the user could take as well as how we
            addressed high priority issues throughout the design. We also
            utilized this time to receive any client feedback related to the
            re-design. The client expressed a need for additional information
            surrounding color; therefore, our team reviewed how we were able to
            adhere to industry standards while also incorporating the original
            inspiration of the client’s color choice. Overall, the presentation
            went well and the client was happy to see her work being displayed
            in a user-friendly way. We shared our drive that contained the style
            guide, final UI, logo, and updated marketing flyer to match the
            redesign.

          <div class="project-body">
            This was not only my first client project, but also my first project
            working in a team. At first I was nervous to see how a group of
            people would be able to work on one design, but I was surprised at
            how easy it was. Our group established good communication from the
            start, meeting over video chat as often as possible to make sure
            everyone was getting the same information as we made decisions. Once
            we established our design elements, we were all able to actively
            work on the same design file and have a cohesive end product.
            <br />
            This project gave me a new perspective on collaborating, as we not
            only had to work as a team, we also had to keep the client's ideas,
            motivations, goals, and insights at the forefront of all of our
            decision making.
